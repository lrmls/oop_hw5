# oop_hw5

First time using git which is why i had my pushes initially split into different folders.
i realized its better to update the code and see the revisions.
git1 is my first coding seession. git2 is my second updated by my third.
I will just update the code in the pushes from now on.

i can create parts and robots. my menu is fleshed out but only the options
for product manager and creating parts and robots are operational.
The .txt file is used to initalize a bunch of parts so a robot can be quickly made.
